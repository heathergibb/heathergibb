# Heather Gibb
Hi there GitHub! 👋

I'm currently a student pursuing a **Bachelor’s Degree in Software Development** from **Brigham Young University - Pathway**. I'm on track to graduate in **early 2026**, and I’m excited to kickstart a career where I can make meaningful contributions as a developer.

## About Me

From the moment I wrote my first `if-then` statement, I was hooked. Later, when I discovered SQL and database design, I was equally enchanted. 🧠

Once I started getting real experience, I realized a few things:
- I really enjoy **back-end development.** I'll admit, I'm a bit of a perfectionist, so I like writing clean, well-structured code that follows standards and is built to handle problems before they happen.
- I love **database design.** There's something really satisfying about organizing data in a way that’s both efficient and easy to work with.
- I'm really good at **software testing** I tend to find and anticipate bugs that others miss, and I actually love the process of making sure everything works just right.
