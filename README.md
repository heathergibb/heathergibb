# Heather Gibb
Hello all! 

I'm currently looking for remote work as a software developer or software tester. I'm pursuing a **Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Software Development** from **Brigham Young University - Pathway** and I'm on track to graduate in **early 2026**, and Iâ€™m excited to start a career where I can make meaningful contributions as a developer.

## About Me

From the moment I wrote my first `if-then` statement, I was hooked. Later, when I discovered SQL and database design, I was equally enchanted. Once I started getting real experience, I realized a few things:

- I thrive when doing **back-end development.** I'll admit, I'm a bit of a perfectionist, so I like writing clean, well-structured code that follows standards and is built to handle problems before they happen.
- My attention to detail and comfort with complexity, help me excel at **database design.** There's something really satisfying about organizing data in a way thatâ€™s both efficient and easy to work with.
- I am natural when it comes to **software testing** and **quality assurance.** I often find and anticipate bugs that others miss because I am thorough and creative in my thinking. And unlike many of the programmers that I've talked to, I really love the process of testing and making sure everything works just right.
